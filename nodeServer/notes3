c0, u1, u2, u3, u4, d5, c6, u7, u8

if seq# for an update is higher than a previous one for the same partid, can discard the old one

consider a create to be a put; if already exists, just replace

drop any deletes if we have a newer create or update for the same object id

when merging actions, keep the newest seq id
